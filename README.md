# Cyclistic Case Study

Case study about a fctional company "Cyclistic".

About Cyclistic In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

GOAL Three questions will guide the future marketing program:

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
Approach -

I downloaded all 12 datasets of year 2023
Then I loaded them into SSMS, where cleaning and data transformation takes place.
First I created an empty table with a schema according to my requirements and then I inserted all the data from 12 tables according to the dataset I created earlier
Then I checked for NULL values and eleminated them.
Also I checked for duplicate values.
Then I checked for negative value in Duration column as duration cannot be negative.
After going through all these steps I had data ready for analysis!
